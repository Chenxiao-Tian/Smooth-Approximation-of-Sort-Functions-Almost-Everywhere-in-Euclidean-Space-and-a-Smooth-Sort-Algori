# Smooth-Approximation-of-Sort-Functions-Almost-Everywhere-in-Euclidean-Space-and-a-Smooth-Sort-Algori
We study a smooth approximation of sort functions almost everywhere in n-dimensional Euclidean Space. A n-dimensional sort function is defined as  f:〖 R〗^n→R^n:  for each n-dimensional  real  vector x∈R^n:  (x_1,x_2,x_3…x_(n-1),x_n )   is translated into  x^'=(x_((1)),x_((2),) x_((3))…,x_((k-1)),x_((k))),  where x_((k)  )(1≤k≤n) is one of the components of 𝑥. At the same time these components have the following order relation, that is, x_((1))≤x_((2) ) 〖≤x〗_((3))…x_((k-1))≤x_((k)). We will show that, this function can be smoothly approximated almost everywhere in Euclidean space, to be more exactly on a subset ϑ⊆R^n,which is ϑ≝{ 𝑥∈R^n |〖 x〗_((k))-x_((k-1))>0, for each k: 2≤k≤n} After that, we will also show how to apply this construction to reorder data points, which can be regarded as a continuous sort algorithm.
